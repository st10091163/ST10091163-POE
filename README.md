Project Description:

The reason behind the creation of the e-Commerce store is to allow the farmer to be able to buy products though a website as opposed to going to the physical store as it will be beneficial to
them to and with the technologies used for the creation of the E-commerce website are:Visual Studios 2022 to run the application,SQL Server Management Studio to allow the test of storing data in a database and saving the data in either a local
matchine and with that issue we have to use a different place to save a database which is a Azure database allowing other users to run the application from their own local machine connecting 
virtually to access the database as the issue with SQL Server Management Studio only the device connected to the database locally can be able to run the Application and thirdly the challenges
faced to make the application was to add a user role for the Employee and farmer for when the user Logs in a certain accounts will be able to have certain features and some will not such as
the the Farmer will not be able to edit other farmers product and details and with an Employee they have to have to have the ability to make changes to the farmers details such as 
the CRUD method CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE as they will be able to have the features of the admin but controlling the website through the application and as this is the feature of adding a role to the 
user i had challenges with as it is a new concept that is still being learned as the and the feature that has to be add a filter the employees and farmers details as it will be there
to have a data sort of what the employee and Farmer wants such as ascending to descending order.
